With the introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks, the fields of object detection and 6D pose estimation have seen large advancements in accuracy and technique. We investigate to verify the applicability of these black-box methods to industrial robotics, especially in the case of tasks requiring high precision.

\textbf{Keywords:} Robotics, Machine Learning, AI, Neural Networks, Semantics, Pose Estimation.
