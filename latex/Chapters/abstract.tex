With the introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks, the fields of object detection and 6D pose estimation from RGB images have seen large advancements in accuracy and technique. We investigate to verify the applicability of these black-box methods for perception tasks in the fields of industrial and collaborative robotics. In particular we devise a method for generating realistic training datasets for objects in a predetermined environment starting from photographs, greatly facilitating the usually laborious and expensive data acquisition phase that is considered to be a pre-requisite for machine learning applications. We then trained a neural network on various experimental datasets of this sort to evaluate its performance. We also devised an approach te extrapolate the semantic state of a scene from the ouputs of a pose estimation network. Finally, we demonstrated the performance of our methods in a real-world scenario by using the output of a trained neural network to plan the movement of a robotic manipulator.
