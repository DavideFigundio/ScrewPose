\section*{Appendix A}
If you need to include an appendix to support the research in your thesis, you can place it at the end of the manuscript.
An appendix contains supplementary material (figures, tables, data, codes, mathematical proofs, surveys, \dots)
which supplement the main results contained in the previous chapters.
